Last Wednesday, my friend Ondra and I performed a significant refresh of our weekend house network.

The objectives were:
1. Connect two buildings with a fibre link
2. Install LTE dish to provide better Internet connectivity
3. Install security cameras so the driveway and the parking lot are monitored

The further objectives are:
4. Segment the network into multiple VLANs - reassign the existing networking and IoT devices
5. Replace the old SSIDs with a single SSID to enable seamless roaming across the property
6. Setup a new firewall rules to secure the infrastructure and allow only the necessary traffic
